## DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
Since I had very little time, and I worked alone, I did not implement everything. But I gave the main idea. Ready to move on!

The idea is to ### increase brand loyalty and trust, get new customers, open up new types of analytics for you and connect offline sales with online!

## HOW I DID IT

I have developed a demo application that may become a good foundation in the future. And so, if we manage to place certain QR codes on your products (With an attractive headline "Scan me and find out how long I am in the store and how long it took to get here." This was an example), people will be interested to look at all the stages that went through meat during its life and before getting on the counter. A person who has scanned the QR code will get into our application, in which he will be able to get acquainted in detail with the products, with their age and expiration dates. Look at all the etopes passed by the pig, for example, how many times she was vaccinated ... Or what the pig has breathed throughout its life ... Or what temperature it lived in ... and so on. When a person is convinced that the product is really good, and you have grown in his eyes again, at the bottom of the page we will convince the client to buy your product 100% by offering him delicious recipes with this particular product.

## WHAT ARE THE PROS FOR THE CLIENT
+ increased brand confidence
+ increased purchase confidence
+ interest (because nearby products do not offer such an option)
+ interest in the product in general
+ attracting new people to goods

## WHAT ARE THE PROS FOR YOU
+ connecting offline shopping with online business
+ additional analytics on people (Through the application, we can find out a huge amount of information about the client if we install certain analytics tools on the page)
+ additional analytics for shops (QR code can carry information about the place where the person scanned the code)
+ if we add a facebook pixel, we can use it in marketing
+ more clients
+ a large volume of information space due to the new application

## WHAT'S NEXT
I would like to develop this product further. I plan to add a convenient editor for adding new products and generating QR codes through the application (the Application still generates QR codes, but it does not do it systematically). Convenient analytics tools right through the app. Mobile app. I also want to figure out how we can convert the scanned item into a purchased item (I think I have an idea).

## WHAT TO DO IN THE APP

  You can go to the page `https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com / code-generator` or` https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com / public / code-generator`. Here you will see an example of a QR code that you can use in your products. Having scanned it, you will be taken to an example page with a product overview. If scanning is not convenient for you, you can go directly to the page `https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com /` or `https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com / public`.
  
  Statistics page `https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com / statistic` or` https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com / public / statistic`.
  
  Product creation page `https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com / product-generator` or` https: // nkscanner.herokuapp.com / public / product-generator`.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
